# Gamification-app

Firstly, I would like to mention that the application is not in it's final state. Due to some pretty serious medical issues I encountered, I could only work roughly around 3 days on the development of the app.

***I will briefly present the whole project in case the .jar or something doesn't work as it should.***

## ***Unfinished features:***
  - Tests!!
  - Commented code
  - Efficient code practice (there are some duplicate functions somewhere)
  - Bug testing
  - Proper error handling (it's actually horrible in its current state :')
  - Tokens mechanism {<br>
<p>
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; By default at the beginning everyone (except the Admin) has the "Junior" rank, which can only solve tasks.<br>
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; For every task, depending on the difficulty, the user was supposed to get a specified amount of points.<br>
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; After achieving a certain total of points, the user will get the rank of "Senior",<br>
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; which can give at most a third of their assigned tasks to lower ranks.<br>

  &emsp; } &nbsp; I was only able to implement the Admin-Junior relation due to reduced time...

## ***Introductory notions:***
  - The local database is populated everytime (ONLY IF IT'S EMPTY!!!) the program is runing (to avoid possible errors..)
  - Accounts: 
<p>
      &emsp; &emsp; (rank = Admin) userName = Admin; pass = admin <br>
      &emsp; &emsp; (rank = Senior) userName = Elena; pass = elena (this account doesn't do anything =)) <br>
      &emsp; &emsp; (rank = Junior) userName = Alex; pass = alex <br>
</p>

<a name="db"></a>
## ***Database:***
  - Each rank has special permissions (see ***Unfinished featutres***).
  - Each user has an encrypted password and an assigned rank.
  - Each task has a difficulty which should show the number of tokens it values (it currently doesn't), a 'UserName' indicating who it has been assigned to, and a state of being 'Done'(1) or 'Not Done'(0).

<a name="setup"></a>
## ***Project setup:***
  - If the database doesn't connect, the **sqlite-jdbc-3.40.0.0.jar** has to be added to the **project modules and libraries**. The .jar can be found in **Accesa-gamification-app\demo**
  - I created a **demo.jar** executable (that doesn't work for me because of some weird JRE version error). The .jar for running the app can be found in **'Accesa-gamification-app/demo/out/artifacts/demo_jar/'**
